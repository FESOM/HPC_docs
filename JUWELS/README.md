### Python environment with pyfesom2
use **stacked conda environments**, so that we don't all have to install the same environments and use up all the inodes on /p/project/. 

We will set up a "master-environment" containing all the standard packages (pyfesom2, xarray, numpy, pandas, cartopy, matplotlib, etc). 

To use stacked environments:

$ conda activate --stack <second_env>  # double minus

or automatically:

$ conda config --set auto_stack 1  # Or True, both are the same

So, what happens? Your PATH gets prepended twice, libraries are first loaded from the outermost (newest or last loaded) part of the stack. There might be odd quirks popping up if you have the exact same version of something in both levels of the stack.
